# Teenage - Color Schemes

A Sublime Text color scheme inspired by the [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering) [Pocket Operator](https://teenage.engineering/products/po) series of musical instruments.

Adds the following color schemes:

- Teenage Board - Dark
- Teenage Screen - Light

Legacy Themes are also available if you prefered those. I do not expect to be updating these going forward, as the two variants diverged from each other, and supported different scopes & syntax features as I was working light or dark scheme at any moment and forgot to update the other.
